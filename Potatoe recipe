## {{< fa basket-shopping >}} Ingredients

- [ ] 800g waxy potatoes
- [ ] 4 big spoons olive oil
- [ ] 2 small spoons mild paprika powder
- [ ] 1 small spoons salt

## {{< fa kitchen-set >}} Procedure

1. First, peel the 800 g of potatoes and cut them into your desired shape: potato wedges, fries, cubes, wedges, or potato slices.
I personally prefer the peeled and quartered wedge shape.
2. Place the cut potato slices directly into a bowl and mix them well with 4 tablespoons of olive oil, 2 teaspoons of mild paprika powder, and 1 teaspoon of salt.
TIP: For variation, you can also mix in 1-2 teaspoons of fresh, chopped rosemary with the potatoes.
3. Then spread the potatoes on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Make sure they are all spread out separately and not stacked on top of each other.
4. They should then bake for about 30 minutes on the middle rack of the oven or until they are lightly browned and cooked throughâ€”just do the fork test or taste test.
IMPORTANT NOTE: The baking time will vary depending on the cut, so keep an eye on them.
I wish you much joy with my oven potato recipe and enjoy your meal.
