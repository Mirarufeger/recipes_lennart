1.    Preheat the oven to 170 Â°C (convection).
1.    Puree dates with cream, vanilla bean seeds, and cocoa powder until smooth.
1.    Then add egg yolks and butter, and blend until the mixture is homogeneous and smooth.
1.    Beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form.
1.    Mix the flour and baking soda into the cocoa mixture.
1.    Gently fold in the beaten egg whites.
1.    Pour the cake batter into any buttered baking pan.

## Notes

The recipe yields 16 pieces and is also suitable for muffin molds. You can enhance the cake with orange zest, ground nuts, nut butter, chili, cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, or cherries.
I use soft dates, which are softer than regular dates.
If you only have firm dates, soak them in warm water for about 4 hours.
I would use a cake pan with a diameter of 18 cm.
